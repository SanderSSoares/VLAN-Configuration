# VLAN Configuration (Packet Tracer)

## Overview
This project focuses on configuring **VLANs on Cisco switches** to improve network segmentation and security.  
It illustrates how VLANs isolate traffic and reduce broadcast domains within a LAN.

## Key Features
- Created and named VLANs  
- Assigned switch ports to specific VLANs  
- Configured trunk ports between switches  
- Tested VLAN connectivity and isolation

## Skills Demonstrated
- VLAN planning and implementation  
- Switch configuration commands  
- Trunking and encapsulation (802.1Q)  
- Basic network troubleshooting  

## Usage
1. Open the `.pka` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
2. Check VLAN assignments on switches.  
3. Verify connectivity within the same VLAN and isolation between different VLANs.  

## Future Enhancements
- Add Inter-VLAN routing for communication between VLANs  
- Integrate a DHCP server to assign VLAN-specific IP ranges  
- Configure security policies for VLAN access control
